        <p>
            While gaming may simply be a hobby for some, it has become the livelihood of a select few. Those who are dedicated and talented at a competitive game they play are given the opportunity to do what seemed impossible 50 years ago: play video games for a living.
            This page will briefly cover how the concept of ‘E-Sports’ began, and how it is slowly evolving into becoming a more mainstream form of entertainment, comparable to the likes of traditional sports like Football or Basketball.

            Challenges of Competing

            <h2>Grueling Schedules</h2>
            <p>
                Just like traditional sports athletes, professional video games player are subject to grueling training schedules too. Furthermore, these schedules may be further extended when the team is not performing up to their desired standards.
                For example, in the Overwatch League, the Shanghai Dragons went on a historic 42 game losing streak, and it was revealed that their training regimen began at 10:30am every day and concluded at midnight. Despite their long training hours,
                their losing streak persisted, and it may have led to an even more intensive schedule than what was revealed by the team themselves.

        <div class="challenge-item">
            <img src="images/ESports/cs.jpg" alt="Lack of Tournaments" />
            <h2>Lack of Tournaments</h2>
            <p>
                In certain E-Sports, the company in charge of the game is not actually actively involved in the E-Sports scene. Hence, the responsibility falls to external companies to organise tournaments to allow the game's
                best players to compete. This leads to the glaring issue, however, that when the companies have little incentive to organise said tournaments, the players suffer as well. No tournaments means no prize money, meaning
                little to no income for the players' teams, which trickles down to the players themselves. This predicament is slowly taking hold of the Counter Strike: Global Offensive scene, where there is a distinct lack of tournaments
                in the North American region.

            <h2>Mental Health</h2>
            <p>
                Whether it is continuous poor performances in matches, the game developer changing the game nagatively, or simply just losing interest in the game, there are a multitude of reasons for players to become jaded
                to the games they have dedicated their lives to. Mental health issues plague E-Sports of all types, as players are under the constant pressure to perform and neglect healthy lifestyle choices as a result.
                These issues, left unchecked, may increase in severity, and eventually lead to a premature conclusion of what could have been an otherwise promising career.

                It is clear that E-Sports as an entertainment medium is going to continue to grow well into the future. As long as there is a healthy supply of new competitive games, gamers all over the world
                will not pass up the opportunity to test their skills at the highest level. That being said, competing at the highest level is never easy, and great thought and consideration must be put in before making the decision to pursue this exciting career path.
